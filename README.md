Boot Camp Class Challenge Week 2 - Portfolio

This challenge requred me to create a web applicaton from scratch.  

Required criteria included the following:
 Developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, links to sections about my work, and how to contact me 
 My first application/work image had to be larger in size than the others.
 When clicking on an application you are takeng to that deployed project.  There are placeholders until I have samples built. 
 When the page is resized the page responds for various screens and devices

I am the only contributor and the website is for educational purposes. An updated version will be launched when work samples are complete and ready to showcase.
